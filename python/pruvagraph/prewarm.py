"""
Arch3 — Predictive Pre-warming

When a file changes → predict what queries the developer will ask next
→ pre-compute those answers using the free-tier query pipeline (no LLM)
→ store in QueryCache.

When developer actually asks → instant answer, zero latency, zero cost.

Key insight: 80% of post-edit queries are predictable from the filename.
  - Edit auth.py → "how does auth work?" is coming
  - Edit user_model.py → "what tables exist?" is coming
  - Edit tests → "what does the tested module do?" is coming
